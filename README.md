# Paging Library Example

This example project uses an API key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org).
Once you have obtained an API key you need to add it to the gradle.properties file where `ApiKey = "YOUR API KEY HERE"` is located.

This app downloads popular movies from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) and displays the movie posters in a RecyclerView via the Android Architecture Components Paging library.
